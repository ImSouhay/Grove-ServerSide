Grove-ServerSide
=====================
### A server-side Forge Mod made for Grove-MC, adds a **PokeDex** and a **PokeTrainer** and a **PokeHunt**.

This is not the full documentation. This mod is no longer being updated, and I am no longer affiliated with The Grove.

You are free to use this mod on your server and modify parts of it to better fit your needs. Just don't claim full ownership, and if possible, give me a mentionâ€”I love seeing my work in action! ðŸ˜„

If anything is not working, try placing the config files somewhere, and run the mod so new files with the new features are made, and then you can copy your old config back, without deleting anything that have been added

## Config:

Most configuration files are located in: `yourServerDirectory/config/lavenderserverside/pokedex` & `poketrainer`.

### `GeneralConfig.json`:
- This file has two simple things, `pokeDexIsEnabled` and `pokeTrainerIsEnabled`, true meaning that its enabled, and false for disabled (if you switch to false while the server is running you will have to restart the server for it to take effect)

### `economy/balances/*.json`:
- This is where players' balances are saved, you can edit it manually from here if you want.

### `pokedex/config.json`:

- `implementedOnly`:
  - Set to either true or false. If true, the PokeDex will only include implemented PokÃ©mon; false includes all.

- `isDexLimitEnabled`: True to activate, false to disactivate it.
- `dexLimit`: The max number of pokemons that show up in the pokedex, caught and needed menus.
  
- `rewardClaimable`: The text showed when a reward can be claimed.
- `rewardAlreadyClaimed`: The text showed when a reward have been already been claimed.
- `claimingMessage`: The message players get when they claim a reward.
- `percentageNeededToClaim`: The text showed informing players what is the percentage needed to claim a reward.
- `currentProgress`: The text showed informing players about their current progress
  
- `rewards`:
  - Contains rewards displayed in the PokeDex `/reward` menu with the following attributes:
    - `progress`: Percentage of PokÃ©mon caught players should reach to claim the reward.
    - `slotNumber`: Slot in the `/reward` menu, ranging from 0 at the top left to 8 at the top right, then 45 at the bottom left, and finally 53 at the bottom right.
    - `itemMaterial`: ID of the item shown in the `/reward` menu (e.g., `minecraft:diamond_sword`).
    - `commands`: Commands executed when the player claims the reward. Use `@player` to represent the player's name.
    - `lore`: Extra lore, for example (`Â§f+5 Â§cRedStone!`), the `@progress` gets replaced by the relevant progress value in each case.
